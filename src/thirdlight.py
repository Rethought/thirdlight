"""
A Python wrapper for the ThirdLight Image Management System API

The `ThirdLight` class provides a convenient, relatively pythonic, transparent
interface to the ThirdLight 'JSON API'.

Once instantiated, calls are made to any available ThirdLight method. If you
see in the ThirdLight documentation the method `Files.GetAssetDetails` you
would call on your ThirdLight instance (e.g. `tl`)::

 tl.Files_GetAssetDetails(assetId=1234)

`assetId`, and indeed any and all arguments passed to the method are put into
the `inParams` dict sent to ThirdLight.

The response comes wrapped in a convenient wrapper that provides dotted
notation access to the returned dictionaries items and also transparently
checks for keys in the `outParams` dictionary so often returned by the API
in which very often you have the values of interest. So, instead of
referencing::

 response.outParams.panoramicUrl

you can more conveniently refer to::

 response.panoramicUrl

        By default this call blocks until the upload is complete. Set
        `block=False` to make asynchronous and monitor the result

        need manually to call `Upload_CompleteUpload` to complete the
        process.

        If a blocking call is made (default) the return value is a
        IMS client reference ID for the uploaded file, otherwise it is the
        `uploadKey`. If an error occurs, `ThirdLightError` is raised.

        The destination can be provided either as a folderId (an integer)
        or a folderPath (UNIX-style, starts at '/' and descends). If
        you specify a folderPath prior to calling `load_folder_tree` the
        tree will first be loaded - this may take some time but is a one
        time operation. By default, if no folderId is specified, the path
        will be used, and that will default to the root '/'.

        A note on duplicates
        --------------------

        ThirdLight is smart about de-duplication. If you upload a file
        that is already in the library it will be sent to an approval
        queue first (`/uploadapprovals.tlx`) for manual acceptance.

        Confusion may arise if you delete a file from your IMS collection but
        then find a new upload does not appear in the destination folder. You
        may find this is because the file has ended up in the approvals queue.
        The reason for this may be that you manually deleted the file but did
        not also purge it from the `trash can`. Whilst the file remains
        *anywhere* in the system, a repeat upload will push it to the approvals
        queue, and this includes in the deleted files (trash can) area.
